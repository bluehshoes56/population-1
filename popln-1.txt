Databricks Dashboard Creation Guide
Based on your code, here's how to create organized dashboards for each metric:

1. Dashboard 1: Merchant Count Analysis
Query to run:

SELECT 
    naics3,
    months_0,
    months_1_4, 
    months_5_8,
    months_9_12,
    months_13,
    months_14_plus,
    total_merchants
FROM presence_distribution
WHERE total_merchants > 100
ORDER BY total_merchants DESC;
Visualization Setup:

Chart Type: Stacked Bar Chart
X-axis: naics3
Y-axis: months_0, months_1_4, months_5_8, months_9_12, months_13, months_14_plus
Title: "Merchant Count Distribution by Month Presence"


2. Dashboard 2: Sales Distribution Analysis
Query to run:

SELECT 
    naics3,
    sales_months_0,
    sales_months_1_4,
    sales_months_5_8, 
    sales_months_9_12,
    sales_months_13,
    sales_months_14_plus,
    total_sales_all,
    pct_sales_months_0,
    pct_sales_months_1_4,
    pct_sales_months_5_8,
    pct_sales_months_9_12,
    pct_sales_months_13,
    pct_sales_months_14_plus
FROM sales_distribution_with_pct
WHERE total_sales_all > 1000000
ORDER BY total_sales_all DESC;
Visualization Setup:

Chart Type: Stacked Bar Chart (for dollar amounts) + Line Chart (for percentages)
X-axis: naics3
Y-axis (Left): Sales amounts
Y-axis (Right): Percentages
Title: "Sales Distribution by Month Presence"


3. Dashboard 3: Transaction Analysis
Query to run:

SELECT 
    naics3,
    txn_months_0,
    txn_months_1_4,
    txn_months_5_8,
    txn_months_9_12, 
    txn_months_13,
    txn_months_14_plus,
    total_txn_all,
    pct_txn_months_0,
    pct_txn_months_1_4,
    pct_txn_months_5_8,
    pct_txn_months_9_12,
    pct_txn_months_13,
    pct_txn_months_14_plus
FROM txn_distribution_with_pct
WHERE total_txn_all > 10000
ORDER BY total_txn_all DESC;
Visualization Setup:

Chart Type: Stacked Column Chart
X-axis: naics3
Y-axis: Transaction counts by month buckets
Title: "Transaction Count Distribution by Month Presence"


4. Dashboard 4: Average Sales Per Merchant
Query to run:

SELECT 
    naics3,
    avg_sales_months_0,
    avg_sales_months_1_4,
    avg_sales_months_5_8,
    avg_sales_months_9_12,
    avg_sales_months_13,
    avg_sales_months_14_plus,
    avg_sales_all,
    pct_avg_months_0,
    pct_avg_months_1_4,
    pct_avg_months_5_8,
    pct_avg_months_9_12,
    pct_avg_months_13,
    pct_avg_months_14_plus
FROM avg_sales_pct_distribution
WHERE avg_sales_all > 1000
ORDER BY avg_sales_all DESC;
Visualization Setup:

Chart Type: Grouped Bar Chart
X-axis: naics3
Y-axis: Average sales amounts
Title: "Average Sales Per Merchant by Month Presence"


5. Dashboard 5: Simplified Comparison (≤13 vs ≥14)
Query to run:

SELECT 
    naics3,
    merchants_13_or_less,
    merchants_14_plus,
    pct_merchants_13_or_less,
    pct_merchants_14_plus,
    sales_13_or_less,
    sales_14_plus,
    pct_sales_13_or_less,
    pct_sales_14_plus,
    txn_13_or_less,
    txn_14_plus,
    avg_sales_13_or_less,
    avg_sales_14_plus
FROM merchant_presence_simplified m
JOIN sales_simplified s ON m.naics3 = s.naics3
JOIN txn_simplified t ON m.naics3 = t.naics3
JOIN avg_sales_simplified a ON m.naics3 = a.naics3
WHERE m.total_merchants > 50
ORDER BY m.total_merchants DESC;
Visualization Setup:

Chart Type: Side-by-Side Bar Chart
X-axis: naics3
Y-axis: Comparison metrics (≤13 vs ≥14)
Title: "Merchant Performance: ≤13 Months vs ≥14 Months"
Steps to Create Each Dashboard:
Run the query in your notebook
Click visualization icon below results
Configure chart settings as described above
Click "Add to Dashboard"
Select your dashboard or create new one
Arrange and resize as needed
Dashboard Layout Suggestion:
Top row: Merchant Count + Sales Distribution
Middle row: Transaction Analysis + Average Sales
Bottom row: Simplified Comparison (full width)
This gives you 5 comprehensive dashboards covering all your month group analyses!
