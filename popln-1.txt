1.2 Business Purpose and Scope
The Debit Network Routing Optimization Model is a critical business decision-making tool designed to optimize payment authorization success rates by intelligently routing debit card transactions between front-of-card networks (Visa, MasterCard) and back-of-card networks (PULSE, STAR, ACCEL, NYCE Premier). The model serves as the primary decision engine for network routing optimization across Fiserv's North Front End platform, encompassing four key operational platforms: North, Bypass, Omaha, and Compass.

The model addresses a fundamental business challenge in payment processing: maximizing transaction approval rates while minimizing processing costs through optimal network selection. Given the substantial transaction volumes processed (approximately 10 billion transactions annually, with 5.4 billion transactions analyzed over a 6-month period), even marginal improvements in approval rates translate to significant business value.
